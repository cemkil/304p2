In order to run this project run

1-) gcc project.c -lpthread 
2-) ./a.out -n 4 -p 0.5 -q 5 -t 3 -b 0.05

Implementation:
We created 1 moderator, n Commentator and 1 breaking event handler thread in this project.
The steps of the process consists of:

1-) moderator checks whether there is questions left
2-) if there are more questions to ask moderator unlock a lock in order to let commentators add themselves to a queue (WHICH WE GET THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE QUEUE FROM GEEKSFORGEEKS)
3-) the last commentator which adds or pass himself to the queue signal for the moderator enqueue a commentator from the queue.
4-)If there is a commentator in the queue moderator unlock a lock for the commentator in the front of of the queue.
5-)The commentator starts speaking for maximum of -t seconds(random) if breaking event occur the turn is passed to the next commentator by the moderator when breaking event finished (implemented via pthread_cond_timedwait)
6-)When all commentators speak for the questions if they add themselves to the queue with probability -p, the moderators and the commentator starts to a new question.

Example log for the parameters -n 4 -p 0.75 -q 5 -t 3 -b 0.05.
